# React App with React Router and All Component

## Description
This project is a React application that includes routing functionality using React Router. It also features an `All` component that renders a list of data based on certain conditions.

## Installation
1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
2. Clone or download the project code.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
1. After the installation, run the following command to start the React application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
2. Open your web browser and access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
3. The Navbar and Search components will be displayed on every page.
4. When accessing the "/all" route, the `All` component will render a list of data based on certain conditions.
5. The data is stored in the `data` array within the `All.js` file.
6. The `values` variable retrieves a value from the local storage to determine the condition for rendering the data.
7. Modify the `values` variable in the `All.js` file or use the local storage to change the rendering condition.

## Code Explanation
- The `All` component is the main component responsible for rendering the list of data.
- The `data` array holds the sample data that is rendered.
- The `values` variable retrieves a value from the local storage to determine the condition for rendering the data.
- The data is mapped and rendered based on the conditions specified in the code.
- The `styles` module CSS is imported for styling the components.
- The `BiRefresh` icon from the `react-icons/bi` library is imported for use in the code.

## Additional Notes
- This project requires Node.js and npm to be installed.
- The project uses React, React Router, and the `react-icons/bi` library.
- Feel free to explore and modify the code according to your needs.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
